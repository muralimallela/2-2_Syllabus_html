            <ol>
                <li> Use Eclipse or Net bean platform and acquaint with the various menus. Create a test project, add
                    a test class, and run it. See how you can use auto suggestions, auto fill. Try code formatter and
                    code refactoring like renaming variables, methods, and classes. Try debug step by step with a small
                    program of about 10 to 15 lines which contains at least one if else condition and a for loop.
                </li> <br>
                <li> Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for
                    the
                    digits and for the +, -,*, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible
                    exceptions like divided by zero.

                        <li>
                            Develop an applet in Java that receives an integer in one text field,
                            and computes its factorial Value and returns it in another text field, when the button named
                            “Compute” is clicked.

                </li><br>
                <li> Write a Java program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters
                    two
                    numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num 2 is displayed in the
                    Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program
                    would throw a Number Format Exception. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an
                    Arithmetic Exception. Display the exception in a message dialog box.
                </li><br>
                <li> Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First
                    thread
                    generates random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, second thread computes the
                    square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube
                    of
                    the number.
                </li><br>
                <li> Write a Java program for the following: <br>

                    lights: red, yellow, or green with radio buttons. On selecting a button, an appropriate message with
                    “Stop” or “Ready” or “Go” should appear above the buttons in selected color. Initially, there is no
                    message shown.

                    empty method named print Area (). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle
                    such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only
                    the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

                    organized as one line per record and each field in a record are separated by a tab (\t). It takes a
                    name or phone number as input and prints the corresponding other value from the hash table (hint:
                    use hash tables).
